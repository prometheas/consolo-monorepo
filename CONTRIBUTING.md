# Contributing

I hope to make this a more explicit document in the future, but for now, let's just keep this to the following points:

1. Thanks for your interest!
2. Please report bugs and feature requests by creating an issue.  Try to have a quick scan to see if someone else has already reported the problem (or requestsed something similar).
3. I accept pull requests!  If the PR is for larger work, please first connect with me (creating an issue is a great way to do this), and let's talk about it first.
4. This should go without saying, but please be respectful to everyone when posting comments on issues and in PRs.

Thanks.
